# ObsidianPress

This is a plugin with set of features to help making notes relevant to content of WordPress.com blogs.

## Current state
Early development/pre-alpha.

## Audience
I write it with [Automatticians](https://automattic.com/about/) using it in mind, but it should be possible to use the plugin with every WordPress.com blog.

## Purpose
ObsidianPress will contain a set of feature that will allow for easier integration of notes written in Obsidian and
blog posts on WordPress.com. Furthermore, I hope it could help to elevate quality of private notes by allowing users
to link personal notes to blog posts or fragments of them.

## Features

### Mentions
User can mention WPCOM users in their notes.
