# ObsidianPress

ObsidianPress is an Obsidian plugin designed to help you connect your notes with the content of WordPress.com blogs.

## Development Phase
Right now, ObsidianPress is in the early stages of development (pre-alpha).

## Intended Users
While I'm building it with [Automatticians](https://automattic.com/about/) in mind, ObsidianPress should work well with any WordPress.com blog.

## Main Goal
The aim of ObsidianPress is to offer features that make it easy to connect notes written in Obsidian with blog posts on WordPress.com. By doing this, I hope to improve the value of private notes by letting users link personal notes to blog posts or parts of them.

## Features
